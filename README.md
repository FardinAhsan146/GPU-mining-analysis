# GPU-mining-analysis

Personal notebook for analyzing GPU mining returns (ETH), will make it more comprehensive.

This notebook will make comparing which GPU to chose for mining any crypto currency significantly easier. No such website or tool allows you to compare the investment side of owning a GPU, even though comparisons on mining exist.
You will only have to add a new instance of the GPU class to the GPU list with the arguments and you will get the analysis of the GPU by running the cells. Get your GPU info from any of the many mining sites with your specific electricity cost. Works with non GPU investments too, just plug in the variables right.

Also since some assets are very volatile, you are probably better off entering the expected value (over the previous year), rather than the current exact value of it right now.

I obtained the stats from minerstat.com based on my electricity cost.

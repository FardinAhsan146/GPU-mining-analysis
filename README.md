# GPU-mining-analysis

Personal notebook for analyzing GPU mining returns (ETH), will make it more comprehensive.

You will only have to add a new instance of the GPU class to the GPU list with the arguments and you will get the analysis of the GPU by running the cells. 

I obtained the stats from minerstat.com based on my electricity cost.

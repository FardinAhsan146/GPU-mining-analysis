# GPU-mining-analysis

Personal notebook for analyzing GPU mining returns (ETH), will make it more comprehensive.

This notebook will make comparing which GPU to chose for mining any crypto currency significantly easier. No such website or tool allows you to compare the investment side of owning a GPU, even though comparisons on mining exist.
You will only have to add a new instance of the GPU class to the GPU list with the arguments and you will get the analysis of the GPU by running the cells. Get your GPU info from any of the many mining sites with your specific electricity cost. 

I obtained the stats from minerstat.com based on my electricity cost.
